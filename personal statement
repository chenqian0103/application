One month ago, a thought popped up in my mind that if we can use geometric perspective to uniformly represent the transition of atmospheric equation within different coordinates when I was reading a paper. So I borrowed some books from library and immediately picked out piece of paper from my backpack to try it. I learnt tensor analysis and applied it in p-coordinate after a few days. The process let me notice geopotential height can be regarded as a derivative variable of metric tensor and the simple continuous equation is caused by pretty form of determination of metric tensor in p-coordinate. Did I get some brand new results? Not really. But I just enjoy the moment I obtain another understanding of atmosphere from a different aspect. This kind of curiosity drives me to explore profound nature of the Earth. That is the reason why I wrote the words to apply Florida State University, an integrated and advanced platform for a young scientist. 
I believe my academic training in the past will be a strong asset to my coming research. My undergraduate and postgraduate study gave me a strong background of math, physics, programing and meteorology, the essence of further research. My scores of statistics and fluid mechanism look like not so good. My undergraduate thesis focused on the location of the Western Pacific subtropical high. And I acquired extensive knowledge about subtropical dynamics and became familiar with the seasonal evolution and process in subtropical region. Later, during my postgraduate research, I modified composite analysis by giving a reasonable weight for every ensemble member when I find the traditional algorithm is not objective, and the work has been published on Atmospheric Science Letters, attaching with my original code for both MATLAB and NCL version on GitHub website. The dynamic and statistic knowledge, together with strong background of coding, enables me to criticize the traditional thinking and test my idea quickly, which I believe will play an important role in my further research. 
In addition, I like to discuss with others and acquire a lot from the discussion from current group. I organized several informal seminars as chairman since my fourth year in Yunnan University when I was an undergraduate student, the topic including MATLAB tips (4 afternoons), stratospheric dynamics, oceanic dynamics (1 evening), climate change and numerical calculation (every evening after the postgraduate class). And since 2015, I attended current group meeting and acquire knowledge about theory of potential vorticity (PV) and subtropical dynamics, especially dynamics about Tibetan Plateau and East Asia monsoon. 
In the future, I would like to investigate on the subtropical climatic variability and its connection with system from different latitudes, especially impact from tropical region. During my master degree thesis about relationship between heat sources over Tibetan Plateau and Philippine Sea, I have discovered some possible mechanism linking subtropical adiabatic heat to tropical cyclones activity. Since I have focused on the subtropical area for almost 5 years, I am quite familiar with the evolution of Asia summer monsoon and relevant topic like ENSO and MJO. I believe the experience will benefit my coming research. Furthermore, Florida State University has a good fame for her edge-cutting investigation of oceanic dynamics and tropical theory, which are both important basis for climate dynamics.
