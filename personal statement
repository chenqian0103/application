One month ago, a thought popped up in my mind that if we can use geometric perspective to uniformly represent the transition of atmospheric equation within different coordinates when I was reading a paper. So I borrowed some books from library and immediately picked out piece of paper from my backpack to try it. I learnt tensor analysis and applied it in p-coordinate after a few days. The process let me notice geopotential height can be regarded as a derivative variable of metric tensor and the simple continuous equation is caused by pretty form of determination of metric tensor in p-coordinate. Did I get some brand new results? Not really. But I just enjoy the moment I obtain another understanding of atmosphere from a different aspect. This kind of curiosity drives me to explore profound nature of the Earth. That is the reason why I wrote the words to apply Florida State University, an integrated and advanced platform for a young scientist. 
I believe my academic training in the past will be a strong asset to my coming research. I made a great effort to build up my basis of methematics in college, especially methematical analysis, reflected by my transcript. And during my undergraduate thesis regarding movement of the Western Pacific subtropical high, I acquired extensive knowledge about subtropical dynamics and became proficient with analyzing data via Linux shell script, GRADS and MATLAB. Since my postgraduate academic life started, I have been paying more attention to tropical dynamics and physical oceanology, enabling me to regard annual variablity of climatic systems as a whole. Florida State University is famous for her investigation on tropical dynamics and has a great honor for her oceanic study, which pretty matches my current demend of knowledge structure, and thus I believe the experience of studying in Tallahassee will elevator my understanding of the atmosphere. 
In addition, I like to discuss with others and acquire a lot from the discussion from current group. I organized several informal seminars as chairman since my fourth year in Yunnan University when I was an undergraduate student, the topic including MATLAB tips (4 afternoons), stratospheric dynamics, oceanic dynamics (1 evening), climate change and numerical calculation (every evening after the postgraduate class). And since 2015, I attended current group meeting and acquire knowledge about theory of potential vorticity (PV) and subtropical dynamics, especially dynamics about Tibetan Plateau and East Asia monsoon. 
In the future, I would like to investigate on the subtropical climatic variability and its connection with system from different latitudes, especially impact from tropical region. During my master degree thesis about relationship between heat sources over Tibetan Plateau and Philippine Sea, I have discovered some possible mechanism linking subtropical adiabatic heat to tropical cyclones activity. Since I have focused on the subtropical area for almost 5 years, I am quite familiar with the evolution of Asia summer monsoon and relevant topic like ENSO and MJO. I believe the experience will benefit my coming research. Furthermore, Florida State University has a good fame for her edge-cutting investigation of oceanic dynamics and tropical theory, which are both important basis for climate dynamics.
